# ReaktorSummerJob

IF YOU HAVE FOUND THIS BEFORE ANYTHING WORTHWHILE IS HERE, PLEASE COME BACK IN 12 HOURS MAX, THANK YOU!
I had corona for two weeks that ended last friday so I had almost no time to work and have been working non stop since then to complete my work. I will not let my sleepless nights go to waste.


Repo for summer job assignment and cover letter.
